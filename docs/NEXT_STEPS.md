# AiRogue Modularization - Remaining Work

## Completed Work

- Extracted specialized generators from monolithic `WorldGenerator`:
  - `ThemeGenerator`
  - `PlotGenerator`
  - `MechanicsGenerator`
  - `ItemGenerator`
  - `TitleGenerator`
- Updated `MODULE_CONTRACTS.md` with concise hybrid format contracts
- Added CLI interfaces for each generator to facilitate testing

## Remaining Tasks

### 1. Fix Generator Bugs

- Fix template parsing issues in `ThemeGenerator`
- Ensure all generators can be run properly from CLI
- Update WorldGenerator to properly use specialized generators

### 2. Complete Testing Strategy

- Create proper unit tests for each generator module
- Ensure each test can run without real API calls (proper mocking)
- Focus on testing the modular generators independently
- Avoid duplicating existing tests of the combined world generation

### 3. Integration Work

- Update `game/world_tools.py` to integrate with the modular generators
- Update `world.py` to use the new modular generator system
- Ensure backward compatibility with existing code

### 4. Documentation Completion

- Complete the remaining sections of `MODULE_CONTRACTS.md` (the sections from lines 17-138 and 252-369 have already been processed)
- Update implementation status in documentation
- Document the new modular architecture in `ARCHITECTURE.md`

### 5. Next Phase: Component System

- After modularization and testing are complete, implement the new LLM-powered component system
- Follow the architecture documented in `ARCHITECTURE.md`
- Focus on clean interfaces between components

## Immediate Priority

1. Fix the remaining bugs in the generators
2. Complete the testing framework
3. Integrate the modular generators with the existing world generation workflow
